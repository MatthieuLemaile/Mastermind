# Mastermind

This project is a mastermind in java. It has no real purpose other than learning some things in Java for me.

Actual version is 1.3 

## Installation

JDK 1.11 is required. Nothing else.

## Miscellaneous

With the proper algorithm, 6 balls/8colors could be resolved in under 6 attempts.

## Things to add

* java module (problem with java.awt imported from two modules.)
* java FX (in place of swing/awt). Maybe wait for something more stable than jfx 11 (it has no packager).
* Add option window menu with a lot of choosing options. how many balls ? how many colors ? how many attempts ?
* Move Credit from in-game menu to a dedicated "credit" part, accessible via an "Ã  propos" option in main menu
* Add a rules option in main menu, with a part with some tips. (Like make a combination that can be same result as previous one, if no green nor orange in result => no more color, ... ?)
